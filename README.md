# 2048
<br>2048 is a single player small give developed in Unity. Users can move the blocks with number either by 4 arrows on the keyboard or by fingers/mouse in all four directions. The goal of this game is to merge the numbers to get 2048 (of course you can get larger number then 2048)! This game can save your highest score on your device and shows on the top-right corner.</br>

The folder '2048_source' contains all the source code of the project.
</br>
<br>
The folder '2048_final' contains the files I extracted from Unity, one .apk file for Android and the other folder with a .exe file for Windows. You can open these files directly and try this game~
